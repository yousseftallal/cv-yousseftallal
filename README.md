# CV Dashboard - Profile Image Management

## Profile Image Update Issue Fix

This update resolves the issue where profile images changed in the admin dashboard weren't appearing on the published Netlify site due to caching problems.

### What was fixed:

1. **Profile Image Storage**: Profile images are now properly saved to localStorage when set in the admin dashboard
2. **Dynamic Loading**: The main site now loads profile images from localStorage instead of using a static placeholder
3. **Cache Busting**: Added cache-busting mechanisms to prevent Netlify from serving cached images
4. **Real-time Updates**: Added a watcher that checks for profile image updates every 2 seconds
5. **Force Refresh**: Added keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+R) to force refresh the profile image

### How to use:

1. **Upload Image**: Go to the admin dashboard and upload an image in the Images section
2. **Set as Profile**: Click "Set as Profile" on the uploaded image
3. **View Changes**: The profile image will update immediately in both admin and main site
4. **Force Refresh**: If the image doesn't update on Netlify, press Ctrl+Shift+R to force refresh

### Technical Details:

- Profile images are stored as base64 data URLs in localStorage
- Cache-busting parameters are added to image URLs to prevent caching
- Netlify configuration (`netlify.toml`) prevents aggressive caching
- Meta tags in HTML prevent browser caching
- Version parameters added to CSS and JS files

### Troubleshooting:

If the profile image still doesn't update on Netlify:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Wait a few minutes for Netlify to rebuild
4. Check the browser console for any errors
