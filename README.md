# CV Dashboard - Profile Image Management

## Profile Image Update Issue Fix

This update resolves the issue where profile images changed in the admin dashboard weren't appearing on the published Netlify site due to caching problems and cross-browser storage limitations.

### What was fixed:

1. **Profile Image Storage**: Profile images are now properly saved using a robust storage system
2. **Cross-Browser Sharing**: Added URL-based sharing system for profile images
3. **Admin Authentication**: Added login system for the admin dashboard
4. **Dynamic Loading**: The main site now loads profile images from multiple storage sources
5. **Cache Busting**: Added cache-busting mechanisms to prevent Netlify from serving cached images
6. **Real-time Updates**: Added a watcher that checks for profile image updates every 2 seconds
7. **Force Refresh**: Added keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+R) to force refresh the profile image

### How to use:

#### Admin Access:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- Go to `/admin/login.html` to access the dashboard

#### Profile Image Management:
1. **Login**: Access the admin dashboard with the credentials above
2. **Upload Image**: Go to the Images section and upload an image
3. **Set as Profile**: Click "Set as Profile" on the uploaded image
4. **Share URL**: A modal will appear with a shareable URL
5. **Copy URL**: Copy the URL and share it with others or use it on different devices

#### Cross-Browser/Device Sharing:
1. After setting a profile image, two shareable URLs are generated:
   - **Full URL**: Contains the complete image data (works immediately)
   - **Short URL**: Contains only the image ID (requires one-time setup)
2. Copy either URL and open it in any browser or device
3. The profile image will automatically load on that device
4. The image is stored locally on that device for future visits
5. Use the "Test Image" link in the navigation to test sharing functionality

### Technical Details:

- **Storage System**: Uses localStorage, sessionStorage, and backup storage
- **URL Sharing**: Images are encoded in URL parameters for cross-device sharing
- **Authentication**: Simple login system with 24-hour session
- **Cache Busting**: Multiple mechanisms to prevent caching issues
- **Fallback System**: Multiple storage methods ensure image persistence

### Files Added/Modified:

- `admin/login.html`: Admin login page
- `js/image-storage.js`: Robust image storage system
- `admin/admin-script.js`: Updated with authentication and sharing
- `script.js`: Updated with cross-browser image loading
- `index.html`: Updated with new storage system
- `netlify.toml`: Netlify configuration for caching

### Troubleshooting:

If the profile image still doesn't update:
1. Use the shareable URL generated in the admin dashboard
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check the browser console for any errors
5. Try opening the shareable URL in a new browser/device

### Security Note:

The current authentication is client-side only. For production use, consider implementing server-side authentication.
